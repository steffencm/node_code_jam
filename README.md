Node Code Jam
==============
Google Code Jam problems solved in NodeJs and Typescript

Node is not a great system to solve these problems in since they tend to be more cpu intensive and that's not exactly nodes forte.
This is mostly just to help learn the ES6 and Typescript syntax and have some fun in the evenings.  

For now you can transpile the files by just running tsc and then running the solution files that get generated in the dist folder.
Output will be created next to input files in data
